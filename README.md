# GeneSVD
This adds nucleotides for four different gene categories (Fox, Hemoglobin, Pero, Olfactory), gets the SVD of each gene's one hot encoded sequence, and takes the dot product to display a heatmap of the genes to show relationships.

Note- Hair, Eye, Metabolism, and Digesion genes are deprecated and were deemed to be useless for results

In order to run the code simply run python geneManager.py
(note- running python version 2.7)
