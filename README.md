# GeneSVD
This adds nucleotides for four different gene categories (Eyes, Hair, Metabolism, and Digestion), gets the SVD of each gene's one hot encoded sequence, and takes the dot product to display a heatmap of the genes to show relationships.

In order to run the code simply run python geneManager.py
(note- running python version 2.7)
